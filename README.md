Leo Task2 Readme
Task 2 is the first iteration of our overall group project.

Source Code Management
This project's Git repository can be checked out with the following command.
Git clone:https://github.com/Valar3726/CS509_Wordsweeper.git

Configurations
This Server applications must be configured to listen on Port 11425 (as is done in my mock client/server 
in the WordSweeper project) and client applications will seek to connect to localhost using this same port 
number.

How to Run
-Start Server
-Connect to Server
-CreateGame
-JoinGame

Professor Submission Note
Be able to execute your server and have a mock client (mine actually) connect.
Demonstrate that server receives a createGameRequest from the mock Client to create a game (no password) and issues a boardResponse with the initiating playerâ€™s board to the client. Follow the protocol where the letters on the board state are comma-separated (this is a change based on 9-27-2016 lecture; review the protocol in wordsweeper.xsd)
Start a second mock Client to connect to your server
Demonstrate that server receives a joinGameRequest for the first game and issues a boardResponse to both the original client and the new participating client
Players should have a position on the board that is randomly selected from the original virtual board state
